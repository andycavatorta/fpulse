FPulse is LED pulsing application.

The specification of pulse sequence for each LED is defined in
a configuration file. FPulse reads configuration file and changes
brightness of LEDs according to the configured specification.

Tested on Raspberry Pi with TLC5947. To run it on Raspberry Pi use provided
Systemd service file or run it manually, i.e.::

    $ fpulse tlc5947 morse.conf

For testing purposes, one can run FPulse on any computer with the following
command::

    $ fpulse print morse.conf

Sample configuration files are in `conf` directory.

TLC5947 Driver
==============
TLC5947 driver was tested with Adafruit 24-Channel 12-bit PWM LED Driver
having SPI interface

    http://www.adafruit.com/products/1429

The connection schematics is presented in the documentation of the driver

    fpulse/driver/tlc5947.py

The TLC5947 driver requires `bcm2835` shared library, which can be
downloaded from::

    http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/

To build the library::

    $ cd bcm2835-{VER}
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ cd src
    $ gcc -shared bcm2835.o -o libbcm2835.so

Install the `bcm2835` shared library in appropriate directory or set
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable appropriately.
